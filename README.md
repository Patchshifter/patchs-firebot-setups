# patchs-firebot-setups
These are my setup files for [Firebot](https://firebot.app).

Feel free to use them, edit them, whatever.  Support will be limited, this is really just a repo for me to share with myself and my friends.


## Installation

Download any of the .firebotsetup files and in Firebot go to Settings -> Setups -> Import Setups and select the file you downloaded.

Each folder has a README of what each thing does with specific instructions.

## High-level list

**See each individual folder for more details about that setup**

* AutoShoutouts:  Automatically shout users out when they first type in chat.
* ChatToTrello:  Adds a chat command to add cards to a Trello Board.  (Note: IFTTT and Trello required)

* TwitchAlertTempaltes: Starter set of alerts for Twitch (follows, raids, subs, etc)
